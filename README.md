# High Throughput Screening (HTS) Data Analysis
This package is a collection of functions, scripts, and data designed to parse, analyze, and visualize high throughput screening data for drug discovery. Of particular interest in this iteration of the package are synergy scores for anchor / library drug combinations. This package is updated and maintained by Maddy Jenner (doctoral researcher in the Yeh Lab at UNC Chapel Hill) and Jack Leary (Yeh Lab computational research assistant).
